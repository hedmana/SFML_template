# CHESS BOARD (WORK IN PROGRESS)
As a chess enthusiastic BioIT student I naturally have to have a home-made chess board to practice my openings on. I wanted to expand my knowledge in C++ and the SFML library so i took this as an opportunity to do exactly that. The result is an SFML based GUI application in the shape of a chess analysis board. Hit me up if you are looking for an opponent :sunglasses:
